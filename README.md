## About the app
- With  the  sudden  surge  in  demand  for  healthcare  support,  the  second  wave  of  COVID-19  brought  India’shealthcare system to its knees.  With such large number of individuals beings affected by COVID, we soonrealized that one of the biggest problems people were facing was getting access to verified resources for oxygen,blood  serum  donors,  hospital  beds,  vaccinations  and  testing. Hence we ended up creating this app to enable easy access to healthcare resources.
- The app allows us to share resources to others in need by uploading the data about resources, which will then be verified by volunteers on the app itself.
- The app also helps people to communicate with healthcare professionals through their contact details.
- CoFind - The application which we have built and are still improving will most definitely impact a lot ofpeople - people in need.  Being able to use our knowledge and skills to help the community is what we consideras our biggest accomplishment through this project.  The fact that we can impact people’s lives and makea positive change in the community is what is keeping our team motivated and will help us in making theapplication even versatile and useful in the future.
